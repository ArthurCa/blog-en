If you are a complete beginer in HTML -- which is totally fine -- and you would like to better understand HTML code, his article is made for you!

I could totally understand that code for software or web-page could be a little bit scary if you are not used to, so I would like to give you a simple example of the best structure and code for an HTML page.

Let me reassure you: no need to understand HTML, code or any specific computer language ðŸ˜‡

This is the conventional structure. from a W3C and SEO point of view

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
<title>Title for your page</title> #It will not be directly displayed on your page, but on search results pages (from Google or Bing for example)
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Main title of your page</h1>
    <p>Text Paragraph</p>
    <h2>Secondary title level</h2>
    <p>Text Paragraph like introduction of your 2 other points</p>
    <h3>Third title level</h3>
    <p>Text Paragraph like a sub-paragraph</p>
    <h3>Third title level</h3>
    <p>Text Paragraph like a sub-paragraph</p>
    <h2>Secondary title level</h2>
    <p>Text Paragraph</p>
</body>

</html>
```


Directly from your browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, ...), and you would like to see the current code, you can `Ctrl + U` (Windows) / `Cmd + Option + U` (Mac OS).
